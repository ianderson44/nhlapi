`{nhlapi}` is an R package that provides functionality to retrieve and process the data exposed by the open NHL API. This includes information on players, teams, games, tournaments, drafts, standings, schedules and other endpoints. A lower-level interface to access the data via URLs directly is also provided. See [below for a full list of endpoints](#implemented-api-endpoints).

## Installation

You can install `{nhlapi}` from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("nhlapi")
```

You can also install the latest development version from the master branch on GitHub using the `{remotes}` or `{devtools}` packages:

```r
# With remotes
remotes::install_github("jozefhajnala/nhlapi")

# Or with devtools
devtools::install_github("jozefhajnala/nhlapi")
```

## Use and develop with Docker

The Docker image [jozefhajnala/nhlapi](https://hub.docker.com/r/jozefhajnala/nhlapi) has RStudio and a set of useful packages for both interactive use of the `{nhlapi}` package and its development. 

Running the following command and opening `localhost:8787` in a web browser should open RStudio with a setup ready for analysis and development. Login user is `rstudio` and password is `pass`:

```bash
# Password can be changed by changing the PASSWORD option below:
# If you need root permissions, add `-e ROOT=true`
docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=pass jozefhajnala/nhlapi
```

## Usage

We retrieve the data from the NHL API by calling the functions exported by the `{nhlapi}` package. They start with `nhl_` so you can easily find them with auto-complete in your favorite editor:
